## Hi there!

I'm [Mikkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkelnothlev/), a XX year old web developer based in Denmark.

I specialize in modern web development with a focus on performance and user experience. My goal is to build scalable and efficient software while providing engaging and flawless user experience.

Outside of coding, I also love to play on my computer at home where I can relax, and I do also enioy anime time from time.
